Clustering is the process of grouping items which are more similar.
Generally clustering uses distance as a metric.
Practically, the real-world data is of very high dimension, so that lower dimensional points become very close to each other
Thus algorithms which performs well at lower dimensions fails at higher dimensions.

Datapoints are usually sparsely located at high dimensions. It means eventhough they have many dimensions, they are highly
concentrated at a particular subspace.PCA is helpful to do clustering at this level. But in somecases datapoints are 
concentrated on the union of many subspaces. There PCA fails. So we need to do subspace clustering.

Subspace: It includes Zero vector. Any two vectors of the subspace multiplied or added among themselves should lie within 
the same subspace. Finally any vector in the subspace if multiplied by the constant should also lie in the subspace.

Applications of Subspace Clustering:
  image representation and compression and computer vision problems like motion segmentation, face clustering, image
segmentation  and video segmentation, hybrid system identification, gene expression analysis, metabolic screening
of newborns, recommendation systems and web text mining.

Types of Subspace Clustering Methods:
              Algebraic
              Iterative
              Statistical
              Spectral-cluster based.
