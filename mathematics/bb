Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Data:
  If we are studying only one variable, two variables, more than two variables of every samples in the dataset then accordingly 
it is known as Univariate, bivariate, multivariate data respectively.

Dependence, Correlation and Causality:
  We all know about dependent and independent variables. The variables which are depedent upon some other variables are called
dependent variables and there may exists a linear as well as non linear dependencies. If dependent variables are particulary linearly
depends (both directly or inversely) on the independent variables then they are correlated. Based on the linear dependency the 
correlation value may lie between -1 to +1. The independent variables may be the real causing agent for the Dependent variables
there comes the causality. Even though two variables may be correlated but it is not necessary there exists a causal effect.
  Now if we know some variables are correlated there exists a greater chance for  causal effect which has many advantages in many fields.
