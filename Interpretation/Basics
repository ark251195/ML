Science: Observe nature; explicitly represent the knowledge
         Requires causal explanation
Deep Learning: Observe data; implicit representationn of knowledge.
               Test accuracy improvement. 
               
Approach 1:
    a) Impose the (physically motivated) inductive bias; on the NN. 
    b) Train them to predict on dynamic physical systems.
    c) Interpret their results & representation to find out the law underlying the system.
    
Inductive Bias:
      There are two types of Biases. Restrictive bias and inductive bias. Restrictive bias will decide what are the space should not 
      be included where as inductive bias will decide among the selected what needs to be selected.
