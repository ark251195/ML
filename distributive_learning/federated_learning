Day-by-day the data has been increasing! The number of devices contributing to this information is also increasing and 
they are with some computational power. Instead of sending all the data to the server and training as a centralized system
which needs increased bandwidth, Federated Learning is preferred.

Federated learning is the process in which instead of sending the whole data only the updates required by the model will be sent.
Thus the model is shared and it is updated or learnt at different settings whilst the privacy is also maintained.

Issues:
  Byzantine Fault
  Local bias
  Poisoning attacks!!!
  
Byzantine Fault:
  The system shows different status to the different users. So the whole system cannot come to some proper consensus.
